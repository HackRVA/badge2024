.SH NAME
png-to-badge-asset \- generate C code from PNG files for use with the badge
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B png-to-badge-asset N png-file ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
png-to-badge-asset generates C code representations of PNG files suitable
for use with the badge firmware.  The value of N should be one of 16, 8,
4, 2, or 1, representing the type of image data you wish to generate,
described below.
.PP
16-bit images: each pixel is represented by 16 bits encoding the color directly
with 5 bits each for red, green, and blue. Transparency is not supported.
.PP
8,4 and 2 bit images: a color map is generated supporting up to 255, 15, or 3
colors, plus transparency, respectively, and for each pixel the color is
represented by an 8, 4 or or 2 bit index into the aforementioned color table.
.PP
1 bit images: No color table is generated, and each pixel is represented by
a single bit.  When drawn, the image colors will be determined by the current
foreground and background colors, as set by FbColor() and FbBackgroundColor().
.PP
The C code is sent to stdout so you can redirect it into a file, or capture
it with the mouse for cutting and pasting into your code.  Diagnostics and
status messages are sent to stderr.

.SH WARNINGS AND ERRORS
.PP
Errors may occur in the following instances:
.PP
Too many colors: The PNG file contains too many colors for the chosen image format.
Choosing an output image format that supports more colors, or posterizing the image
to reduce the number of colors present may help.
.PP
Image too large: If you process images larger than the display of the badge (128 x 160)
a warning will be issued (but the image will still be processed.)
.PP
Transparency ignored: If you process a PNG file which contains an alpha channel
into the 1 or 16 bit images formats, a warning will be issued as these formats
do not support transparency. The image will still be processed.
